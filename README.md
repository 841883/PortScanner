# PortScanner
Simple Python port scanner

Simply scans for open ports on a given IP address. 

Accepts port ranges to search for. 

Build it into an exe using *Pyinstaller --onefile PortScanner.py* or execute via command line *python PortScanner.py*.

Or use the CLI version, which can be executed like so: *python PortScanner-CLI.py IP_ADDRESS START_PORT END_PORT* -- using enviornment variables you can shorten this to whatever desired.
